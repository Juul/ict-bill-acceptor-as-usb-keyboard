/*

  This program expects pulses of logic high coming from a bill acceptor into a GPIO pin on an arduino leonardo or anything with an Atema32u4 and an arduino compatible boot loader.
  It counts the number of pulses, pretends to be a usb keyboard and types the dollar amount followed by a newline after each bill has been accepted e.g: "5.00\n"
